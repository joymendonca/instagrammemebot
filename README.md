# instagrammemebot
JoySendsMemes is a web scraper bot made with python using selenium which sends a random meme to any user that messages it.

Requirements:
Python3
Selenium
Chromedriver (Depends on what chrome version you are on I was on 83.0.4103.61 so that is the chromedriver I have provided)

You can download latest or old versions of chrome driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
If you do not use the proper version of chrome driver the code wont work.

Setup:
Just edit the logininfo.txt file with your instagram username and password and you are good to go just run the code.
Sometimes due to unstable internet connection the program might crash just re-run it in that scenario.
